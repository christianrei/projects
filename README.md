# The tar.gz file is a day planner program I created for a university OOP class. It has a working GUI and makes use of objects and inheritance

The other files were required files to make our own ADT in a class called Software Development and Integration. The ParameterManager struct is a table the stores the information of the stuct Parameter. I have used chaining to deal with collisions in my table. The program was also required to make use of unions which I managed to successfully do by teaching myself.
