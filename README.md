### dayplanner
This is a day planner program I created for a university OOP class. It has a working GUI and makes use of objects and inheritance.

### ParameterManager
A custom ADT for a class called Software Development and Integration. 

The ParameterManager struct is a table the stores the information of the stuct Parameter. I have used chaining to deal with collisions in my table. The program was also required to make use of unions which I managed to successfully do by teaching myself.

### A3
This folder contains files for a full compiler program. It makes use of the Parameter Manager described above and uses JNI to create a GUI from it. This GUI creates another Java file with a GUI to display results of the compilation.

### Deal or No Deal
Fun Java GUI based Deal or No Deal game with art and sounds that functions just like the famous TV show.

### N1 
N1 is a mail application that makes use of plug-ins that this account has forked. Most git changes are done on a partners github account.
